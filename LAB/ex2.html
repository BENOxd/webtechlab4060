    <h2>ABOUT LOUD</h2>
    <hr color="greenyellow">
    <p>They are known for their rivalry with the North American team <em>OpTic Gaming</em>, stemming from Stage 1 Masters Reykjavik 2022, up until their final rematch with them in the <em class="red">VALORANT Champions 2022 grand finals</em>, in which LOUD defeated OpTic Gaming. Considering that the OpTic Gaming core is now with NRG, the current record of their rivalry from their matchups is currently at 4-3 in favor of LOUD with a home territory win in VALORANT LOCK//IN SÃ£o Paulo.
        They are the inagural champions of the VALORANT Champions Tour 2022 season, and the sixth winner of an international event overall, after their triumph against their fierce rivals of the 2022 season, OpTic Gaming.</p>
